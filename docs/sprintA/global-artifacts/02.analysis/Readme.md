###**Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes**###

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations: 

+ **_Adress_** is physically or logically part of **_Property_**
+ **_Property_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_Adress_**
+ **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
+ **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
+ **_Owner_** uses or manages or owns **_Property_**
+ **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
+ etc.



| Concept (A) 		|  Association   	|  Concept (B) |
|----------	   		|:-------------:		|------:       |
| C1  	| verb1    		 	| C2  |
