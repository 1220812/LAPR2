# US 003 - To register an employee

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As an organization employee, I want to register a new employee .



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications


**From the specifications document:**

> Each employee is characterized by the name, the citizen number, the tax number, the adress, the email address, the telephone number and the agency to which it is assigned.
> Each employee has his own role.
> For each employee a random password is generated for him.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** The administrator when registering a new employee will also have to specify the category/office that he will perfom ?
>
> **Answer:** The administrator has to specify the role of the employee.


> **Question:** When a System Administrator (admin) makes a request to register a new employee or a new network branch (or any other alteration), does the System ask for the admin credentials (login, password)?
>
> **Answer:** The System Administrator should be logged in the application.


> **Question:** When registering a new employee, will the administrator set the respective employee password?
> 
> **Answer:** The password should have eight characters in length and should be generated automatically. The password is sent to the employee by e-mail.


> **Question:** Does the System Administrator have permission to create, edit, delete, or just create new employee registrations?
>
> **Answer:** For now, the System Administrator can only do what is specified in the Project Requirements.


> **Question:** Can an employee be registered to more than one agency?
>
> **Answer:** No.


> **Question:**  What would be the attributes of the System Administrator, Agency and the Roles?
> 
> **Answer:** The System Administrator is an employee. You can get the roles from the project description. Please check the project description.
Moreover, I just answered a question to clarify what are the attributes of an agency/store.


> **Question:** The statement specifies 3 different types of employees. 
The admnistrator, the agent and the store manager. Do we consider that there are only that  functions for employees or are there more?
>
> **Answer:** On this subject everything has already been clarified. 
Please check the project description and the posts I wrote in this forum.


**Question:** To register a system administrator, beyond the characteristics already defined on project description, the system administrator should have a list of the agencys available?
> 
> **Answer:** I do not understand your question.
