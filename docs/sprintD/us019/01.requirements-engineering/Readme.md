# US 019 - Divide the set of all stores into two subsets

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a network manager, I want to divide the set of all stores into two subsets,
so that the total number of properties of the stores between the two subsets is
the closest possible.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

> Each store in the network has a store manager and the set of stores is managed by a store network
manager. The main functions of a store manager are to monitor and streamline the branch with the
aim of getting to know better the business carried out and to analyse and evaluate the performance
of employees.


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question: (02/06/2023)** In US019, our team had some doubts regarding the information that is going to be analyzed. According to many MDISC teachers, we are only supposed to process the information within a CSV file chosen by the network manager. However, in the US description and acceptance criteria there isn't any mention of this, implying that we need to use all the information that's registered in our system. This situation also applies to MATCP, seeing the regression models, according to subject teachers, also should be generated using the CSV file information.
Additionally, if it is only supposed to be the CSV file information, can we ask for the file path of it?
>  
> **Answer:** n USs 17, 18 and 19, the network manager and the store manager should be able to explore/analyze ALL deals that are registered in the system.
To develop the work required by MATCP and MDISC courses, you should have a clean/empty system and you should load the CSV file that is already available in moodle (please the link "CSV file generated by the legacy system to be explored in US17, US18 and US19" available in moodle).


> **Question: (02/06/2023)** Should the CSV legacy file be used as a file that has the purchase orders that were accepted and therefore be used in the US019 or does the CSV file not contain the type of deals we are looking for??

> **Question : (09/06/2023)** Q: In US19 on AC3, when generating the lists for the runtime tests, do we have to include the full format provided in the csv given to us, or just the relevant parameters for this specific us?
> 
> **Answer:** I think I do not understand your question. Even so, in a previous answer I said:
"In USs 17, 18 and 19, the network manager and the store manager should be able to explore/analyze ALL deals that are registered in the system.
To develop the work required by MATCP and MDISC courses, you should have a clean/empty system and you should load the CSV file that is already available in moodle (please check the link "CSV file generated by the legacy system to be explored in US17, US18 and US19" available in moodle)."
Moreover, if you read carefully the AC2 and AC3 of US19 you will figure easily what is the input and output that I want you to consider.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** The application should implement a brute-force algorithm, an algorithm
which consists of calculating all the partitions of cardinal 2 and finding out which
one is the minimum for the difference of the sum of the elements of each sublist


**AC2:** . The algorithm should return the sublists of the partition (each sublist should
contain a set of tuples with two elements each, the storeID and the number of
properties manage by the store) that satisfies the stated condition and also the
difference between the sums of the elements of the sublists. In the user manual,
this algorithm must be written in pseudocode.


**AC3:** Runtime tests for variable length n input lists, with com n = 3, 6, 9, …, 30
(asymptotic behavior) should be performed. In each run the number of stores
should be chosen sequentially. In the user manual, the results of measuring the
time of each algorithm for one/several inputs of the same size, as also the graphic
of the asymptotic behavior of the execution time should be presented (use a unit
of time that allows you to distinguish the running times of all tested examples).
Also, it should be presented the input list, the two sublists that make up the
partition and difference of sums, for at least one example of each input size.

**AC4:** Worst-case time complexity of the algorithm should be documented in the
application user manual (in the annexes, where algorithms should be written in
pseudocode) that must be delivered with the application. 

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There could be a dependency in US012 since it´s fundamental that the data from the legacy files system is into the system to be used in this user story;

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

*  number of stores in each subset;

**Output Data:**
   * run time algorithm;
   * list of stores in each subset;
   * difference between the sums of the elements of the sublists;
