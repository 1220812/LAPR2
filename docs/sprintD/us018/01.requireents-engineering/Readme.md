forecast values.

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a store manager, I intend to analyse the deals (only sale of houses and
apartments) made. In particular, I intend to compare property sale values with the
forecast values. The prediction of the value of the business/property must be
estimated based on the characteristics of the property and using linear and
multilinear regression algorithms.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

> Each store in the network has a store manager and the set of stores is managed by a store network
manager. The main functions of a store manager are to monitor and streamline the branch with the
aim of getting to know better the business carried out and to analyse and evaluate the performance
of employees.


**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question: (02/06/2023)**  In US018 it is stated that its purpose is to analyse deals made in order to "compare property sale values with the forecast values". However I don't understand what exactly does the user input. Does the user select a property and receives it's predicted value? Does he select a deal and compares the sale price with the predicted price? Or does he not input anything (other than the desired regression model) and just gets the regression model as output? If so, does he receive the regression model as a graph or just as an equation?
>  
> **Answer:** Please discuss this question with MATCP teachers. Moreover, please read carefully the AC3 of US18.
In a previous answer I also said:
"n USs 17, 18 and 19, the network manager and the store manager should be able to explore/analyze ALL deals that are registered in the system.
To develop the work required by MATCP and MDISC courses, you should have a clean/empty system and you should load the CSV file that is already available in moodle (please the link "CSV file generated by the legacy system to be explored in US17, US18 and US19" available in moodle).

> **Question: (02/06/2023)** Should the CSV legacy file be used as a file that has the purchase orders that were accepted and therefore be used in the US019 or does the CSV file not contain the type of deals we are looking for??

> **Question : (01/06/2023)** A report containing regression methods, confidence intervals, and other US-related aspects of MATCP is mentioned in the Sprint D requirements document for US018. The team is wondering if this "report" refers to information that should be displayed in the application itself, the user manual, or both. And if the "report" isn't going to be displayed in the app, are we only going to show the user the forecasted price in relation to the chosen property and the regression model with all the necessary statistics?
> 
> **Answer:** In US18 the application should show, to the store manager, the forecasts, the regression model, statistics, etc.. The teams should use this output of the application to write the report (annexes of the user manual).

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1:** The goal of this US is to forecast property sale prices (only for houses and
apartments) using information from the property area (in square feet), the
distance from the center (in miles), the number of bedrooms, the number of
bathrooms and the number of parking spaces features of each property. In this
study, simple linear and a multi-linear regression models should be developed to
find the linear relationship between: 1- each independent variable and the
dependent variable; 2- all independent variables and the dependent variable. As
the application is under development it is not possible to generate all data
required for the analysis. Therefore, and to simulate a production system, we
made available in moodle a CSV file (generated by the legacy system) containing
information required for this study. The regression analysis should be
documented in the application user manual (in the annexes) that must be
delivered with the application. The report should include property values/prices
(sale prices and forecast prices), the regression model used to estimate each
value, R(SLR), R2 and R2 adjusted for SLR and MLR, confidence intervals and
hypothesis tests for regression coefficients and significance model with Anova


**AC2:** All houses and apartments business registered in the system should be used
to fit the regression models.


**AC3:** The system should enable the actor to select each regression model and
should present the price estimates using the selected model. Moreover, the
system should show the selected regression model and all required statistics.

**AC4:** To implement this US the org.apache.commons.math4.stat package
(https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/stat.html)
should be used.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There could be a dependency in US012 since itÂ´s fundamental that the data from the legacy files system is into the system to be used in this user story;

### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* path of the information file;
* regression model;
* parameters to be used by the chosen regression model;

**Output Data:**

* prediction
